    <h3>How to cook my favorite food - Tuwo ðŸ˜Š</h3>
    <img src="image/Tuwo-Shinkafa-with-Beans-Soup-Gbegiri-and-Egusi-Soup-797x598.jpg" alt="">
    <ol>
        <li>500g Arborio rice (any other small grain or long grain rice would do just fine too)</li>
        <li>Water</li>
    </ol>
    <p><b>Rinse</b> the rice and place in a pan, cover with <strong>enough water</strong> to cook about 3 inches high and place on a medium heat ðŸ”¥. <mark>Keep an eye</mark> on the rice to avoid burning and add more water if <sup>needed</sup>. The rice can be very tricky to cook but if you keep the heat on a medium heat, you shouldn't have any trouble with it. Cook rice till it is <mark>soggy and mushy</mark>. If you have a <b>hand mixer</b>, here is the time to get it out to make your job faster and a lot easier and if you donâ€™t have a hand mixer, get your wooden ladle, time to work those arms baby. Use the hand mixer to smoothen the rice together till it all comes together and sticky. Same method applies if you are using the wooden ladle. Serve the <mark>Tuwo</mark> rice as you would with any other swallow and pair with soup of <mark>choice</mark>ðŸ˜‹. I served mine with miyan kubewa. ðŸ˜‹, it was too good to be true.</p>
